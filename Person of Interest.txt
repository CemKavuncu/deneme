If you can hear this, you’re alone. The only thing left of me is the sound of my voice. So let me tell you who we were. Let me tell you who you are. Someone once asked me if I had learned anything from it all. So let me tell you what I learned. I learned: everyone dies alone. But if you meant something to someone; if you helped someone; or loved someone; if even a single person remembers you; then maybe you never really die. And maybe, this isn’t the end at all.
